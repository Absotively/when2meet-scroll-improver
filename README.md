# When2meet scroll improver
Userstyle to improve scrolling behaviour when hovering over Group's Availability on When2meet.

Moves the availability list sideways, which is not ideal but I haven't bothered to work out a way to stop it.

Requires [Stylus](https://add0n.com/stylus.html).

[Install When2meet scroll improver here](https://github.com/Absotively/when2meet-scroll-improver/raw/main/w2m-scroll.user.css).
